# Notes on my coding journey


## Jan 11 2022

==============
So far coding has been quite fun, challenging but fun. My previous project have been quite a mess, but my recent one is a bit of an improvemnt. I am starting to note down my daily progress as sometimes I am unable to commit new changes to my current project.
I am trying to create web design systems, which is a small project from codecademy. The project in essence is complete all criterias have been met. Although I beleive that I can make the site better and since I have already started the foundation it might be easier to add features rather than starting new project all over again.
