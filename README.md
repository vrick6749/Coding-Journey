# Notes on my coding journey


## Jan 11 2022

==============
\
So far coding has been quite fun, challenging but fun. My previous project have been quite a mess, but my recent one is a bit of an improvemnt. I am starting to note down my daily progress as sometimes I am unable to commit new changes to my current project.
I am trying to create web design systems, which is a small project from codecademy. The project in essence is complete all criterias have been met. Although I beleive that I can make the site better and since I have already started the foundation it might be easier to add features rather than starting new project all over again.  

Currently I am doing a project in codecademy, where I have to create a ball via css and html.... The ball then must bounce, where the <strong>animation is slowed down</strong> via css transition.. 
To add some responsiveness, <strong>inputs are added via eventlistener </strong>. <em>The main even listers I have used so far are scroll, keyup, keydown, keypress</em>
The ball bounces and code is fully functional....  
Although my main point in confusion is why did they use float for the circle... will be further investigated and will try to answer question on next update of this repo.  



..........................  
<strong>Answer I currently have is that float takes the item out of the block scope and permits inline elements to wrap around the item with the property of float.... Maybe it made styling easier since the ball was using padding to move around, float will mean that whomever did the code will not have to worry about much of the other elements on the page making styling easier</strong>

Currently trying to practice another coding challenge <strong>Piano keys</strong> cannot get the grasp of it... main challenge faced is confusion with viability of anonymous function/ function declaration and named function inside scripting.... In theory it should work, yet to try. I have reset the code base to take another attempt, as I edited my code and followed the guide exactly as outline 'even changing my initial syntax'.... to finally see an error in the last line which was a non camel cased forEach!!!!!!!!!!, which I think was the initial reason as to why code was not working. \

I will try again with my own solution and re run the program.

<strong>OK!!! soo function declaration and fucntion expression is selective in triggering actions in scripts.... did a lot of editing.. for ref: ...... "function doThis(){}" is a declaration....."let func = fucntion(){}"is a function expression</strong>
