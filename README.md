# Notes on my coding journey


## Jan 11 2022

==============
So far coding has been quite fun, challenging but fun. My previous project have been quite a mess, but my recent one is a bit of an improvemnt. I am starting to note down my daily progress as sometimes I am unable to commit new changes to my current project.
I am trying to create web design systems, which is a small project from codecademy. The project in essence is complete all criterias have been met. Although I beleive that I can make the site better and since I have already started the foundation it might be easier to add features rather than starting new project all over again.  

Currently I am doing a project in codecademy, where I have to create a ball via css and html.... The ball then must bounce, where the <strong>animation is slowed down</strong> via css transition.. 
To add some responsiveness, <strong>inputs are added via eventlistener </strong>. <em>The main even listers I have used so far are scroll, keyup, keydown, keypress</em>
The ball bounces and code is fully functional....  
Although my main point in confusion is why did they use float for the circle... will be further investigated and will try to answer question on next update of this repo.
